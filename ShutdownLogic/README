Run via command line by typing:

 ./a.out <temp in> <thresholds in> <max line length> <output file name>
 
The max line length should be a large number such as 255. The thresholds in should
be configured with the first row being the total number of devices in the left
column and the remaing rows should have upper temperature limits in the left 
column and lower temperature limits in the right column. 

Compile with gcc.
